MapsTest
========

This is an Android application to test Google Maps integration. The folder includes the Eclipse generated .classpath and .project files so it should be easy to import into Eclipse.

Setup
-----

In order to run, Google Play services must be installed. If you are using the Android SDK, open the Android SDK Manager, and install Extras -> Google Play services.

Import the library that was downloaded into Eclipse via File -> Import -> Android -> Existing Android Code into Workspace.

Finally, define a dependency in your Android project.
